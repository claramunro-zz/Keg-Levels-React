# Keg Levels  :beers:

Initially built with Angular, this is a react app to track bar keg levels. CRUD web application for a tap house.

## Component Tree

* I already added state components for the form -- going to work on implementing a keg starting at "124 pints" & a "sell 1 pint button" that will decrease the amount by 1. I think I will need to seperate the kegList to kegItems to keep track of each individual pints left.

* Working on implementing functionality

* Creating a seperate view for the New Keg Form
* Error 404 Page, possibly add some styling
* React structure seems to make more sense to me than Angular, I'm sure there are something I don't know but so far I'm feeling good about it!

## Setup Instructions :gear:

* Clone repository on your local computer
* Navigate into project directory
* Install node package manager if not already installed
* Run '$ npm install' to download all dependencies
* Run '$ npm run start' to serve the app on localhost:8080

## Angular vs. React

* Syntax is simplified in React
* Re-using components seems easier and more dynamic in React
* Programming in React without prior planning is difficult and leads to more problems by comparison
* No services to handle move info around in React

## Languages / Libraries Used   :computer:
* Webpack
* React
* JSX
* JavaScript
* Hot Module Replacement
