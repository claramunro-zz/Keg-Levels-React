# Keg Levels

Initially built with Angular, this is a react app to track bar keg levels.

## Component Tree

![Component-Tree](/images/Keg-Levels.png)

### Notes on Tree

* Creating a seperate view for the New Keg Form
* Error 404 Page, possibly add some styling
* Once I add stateful components I'm sure things will change up a bit
* React structure seems to make more sense to me than Angular, I'm sure there are something I don't know but so far I'm feeling good about it!

## Setup Instructions

Will add.

## Angular vs. React

* Syntax is simplified in React
* Re-using components seems easier and more dynamic in React
* Programming in React without prior planning is difficult and leads to more problems by comparison
* No services to handle move info around in React

## Languages / Libraries Used
* Webpack
* React
* JSX
* JavaScript

## Known Bugs
